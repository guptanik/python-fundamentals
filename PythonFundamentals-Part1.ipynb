Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly powerful too which is very commonly used in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. Although we will not be discussing any DS or ML stuff in this series of post, i prefered to use Jupyter Notebook instead of any other IDE as it will help me become a little more comfortable using Jupyter Notebooks. You can use any IDE of your choice. If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks and want to try it out, you can read my post on starting with Jupyter [***here***](http://learningmlandai.com/introduction-to-jupyter-notebook/)."
