Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.`\n",
    "\n",
    "***Technically*** - Jupyter Notebook is built off of IPython, an interactive way of running Python code in the terminal. The IPython Kernel runs the computations and communicates with the Jupyter Notebook front-end interface. Jupyter Notebook extends IPython by providing a web-based application suitable for capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and executing code, as well as communicating the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook integrates code and its output into a single document that combines visualizations, images, mathematical equations, and other rich media. This means that you can write both code and normal text (using the Markdown format) in a single notebook and can execute these and the results will be displayed inline within the notebook. This intuitive workflow promotes iterative and rapid development and makes a Jupyter notebook easy to read and share."
