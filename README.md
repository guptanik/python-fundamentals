# Python-Fundamentals

**Python** was and still is one of the most popular programming language owning to its powerful, fast and dynamic nature. Being easy to learn because of its very english like syntax, it has gained a lot of popularity and adoption in a very short time. Because of the presence of a vast and active online community and availability of a large number of open source packages, today Python is being used in a wide variety of applications ranging from web development to mathematical computing and data analysis.

Python is heavily used in the field of ML and AI as well. So being proficient in Python is almost a necessity to succeed as a ML/AI engineer. As I began my journey in the field of ML and AI by learning Python, I decided to create a series of post to share my knowledge and findings with all. In any normal tutorial or post, a bare minimum number of examples are provided and often I was left wondering with different cases that were not discussed or cases that could have proven to be exceptions. So in these posts i have included a lot of examples trying out different things as I go along.

You can read all the posts in the series [here](http://learningmlandai.com/python-fundamentals/)

I have created all these posts using Jupyter Notebook. This repository contains the source notebooks of all the posts.
